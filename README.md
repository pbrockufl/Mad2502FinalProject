MAD2502 Final Project - Soccer Financial Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between financial spending and club success in European soccer, with a focus on the Premier League. It also compares the influence of spending across different top European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1).

Features:
- Compute yearly spending from transfers and wages (Premier League only)
- Fit regression models (spending vs league points, squad value vs points)
- Compare Premier League vs other leagues on European success
- Predict expected points based on financial inputs
- Visualize scatter plots with regression lines and performance equations

Files:
LeagueAnalyzer.py - main class containing analysis and plotting methods
main.py - example script to run comparisons
EPL_Data.csv - Premier League financial and performance data
Top_5_Data.csv - Top 5 European leagues data 

How to Run:
